## IMPORTANT

It is recommended that you download the latest release from the official website.

Downloading a development version directly from the repository might give you unexpected results, such as visible errors, functions that are still not finished, etc.

## Documentation

Docs are maintained at https://projectsend.gitbook.io.
There you will find installation requirements, instructions, tutorials, and troubleshooting information.

## Developing

If you want to help with development, you will need to do a few things via the command line:

1. Download the npm and composer dependencies with the commands ````npm install```` and ````composer update````
1. Run the default gulp task simply with ````gulp```` to compile the main CSS and JS assets files.
